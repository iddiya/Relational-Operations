The testing will start in MovieDB.java, the entry point for the project used for testing.
We have performed unit testing using J-unit to test the individual relational operators.
The test cases are written in "JunitTest.java" for all the relational operations.
All the test cases are validated with the expected output tables.
To start the unit testing test cases, we must run the "JunitTest_project2.java". (before running the file, please make sure that all the necessary packages are available) Note: make sure that "JunitTest_project2.java" exists in the source folder.
